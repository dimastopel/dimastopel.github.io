My name is Dima Stopel. Currently I am VP Engineering at Palo Alto Networks. I moved to Palo Alto Networks as part of the acquisition of [Twisltock](https://www.twistlock.com) where I was VP of R&D and co-founder. Previously I worked at Microsoft, Deutsche Telekom, and couple of other companies. 

I am a software engineer and a geek. I am mostly interested in cryptography, machine learning, and math.
